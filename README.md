# Enhanced Chat Client & Server
# Description
## What?
We plan on improving and adding to the chat program which we started in Lab 3. This would include adding multiple new features, including but not limited to: <br />
- Executable client with a GUI <br />
- Multiple clients on one server <br />
- Ability to send message without waiting on response <br />
## Why?
We were interested in the idea of a chat client upon completion of Lab 3. With it being our first exercise in socket programming, we were impressed by the ability to send messages between a client and server. We wanted to expand our knowledge and improve the chat program beyond what we had done in class.
## How?
We will be using Python to create our client and server. Once a server is established, multiple clients would be able to connect to it. Any messages sent by any of clients will be visible to everybody.
# Deliverables
At the end of the semester, we will be able to deliver: <br />
- A chat server, able to handle multiple clients <br />
- A chat client executable with a GUI <br />
- A functioning program allowing communication between multiple clients <br />
# Plan
Week 1: The server will be fully functional. <br />
Week 2: The clients will be able to send and recieve messages. <br />
Week 3-5: Add individual features one-by-one. If we are finished early, then we will implement new features. <br />
Week 6: Be ready to deliver a fully functional chat program. <br />
