# Enhanced Chat Client & Server
# Description
## What?
We plan on improving and adding to the chat program which we started in Lab 3. This would include adding multiple new features, including but not limited to: 
- Executable client with a GUI 
- Multiple clients on one server
- Ability to send message without waiting on response 
## Why?
We were interested in the idea of a chat client upon completion of Lab 3. With it being our first exercise in socket programming, we were impressed by the ability to send messages between a client and server. We wanted to expand our knowledge and improve the chat program beyond what we had done in class.
## How?
We will be using Python to create our client and server. Once a server is established, multiple clients would be able to connect to it. Any messages sent by any of clients will be visible to everybody.
## Deliverables
At the end of the semester, we will be able to deliver: 
- A chat server, able to handle multiple clients 
- A chat client executable with a GUI
- A functioning program allowing communication between multiple clients 
## Plan
Week 1: The server will be fully functional. 
Week 2: The clients will be able to send and recieve messages. 
Week 3-5: Add individual features one-by-one. If we are finished early, then we will implement new features. 
Week 6: Be ready to deliver a fully functional chat program.

# Comments
1. In addition to supporting multiple clients at the same time and exchanging text messages, do you plan to add any other features to make it more fun? List a tentative of features that you plan to add. (RESOLVED)

# Post Completion
## Getting Started
- Installing:
1. Download .zip containing the chat program's files.
2. Extract .zip.
3. Assure that Python is installed. If not, it can be downloaded here:https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Running:
1. Open the server's .exe file. A server will then be started on your local IP address.
2. Open the client's .exe file, located in the Client folder.
3. Once the client has opened up a Python terminal, enter in the IP address of the server, as well as the port the server has started on (will be displayed on server start-up).
4. Your chat client will now be open! To exit, either type {quit} or simply exit the window.
## Features
- GUI: Fully functional GUI with a message box and chat display window
- Emoji: A small set of emoji that can be accessed through a !emoji command
- Screen-names: Upon entering the chat room, the user may select a name
